                        <p>The Coaching and Audit SOP outlines the process for conducting regular audits and coaching sessions to improve customer experience and develop team members' skills. Supervisors are responsible for conducting 3 audits per team member per week, plus 1 coaching session.</p>

                            <li>The 3 audits should not be performed on the same day for a team member; they should be spread throughout the week.</li>
                            <li>Coaching sessions should focus on developing agents' skill sets by addressing the main obstacles that prevented agents from delivering best-in-class customer service experiences.</li>
                            <li>All coaching must be documented using the coaching app.</li>
                            <li>The coaching plan should be sent every Wednesday to WFM for mapping, and sessions should not exceed 30 minutes.</li>

                            <li>Customers can either submit a business review or complaint through BBB.</li>
                            <li>BBB will review and notify us via email about the new review/complaint filed against our brand and will outline the due date to resolve (not responding on time leads to a downgrade in BBB rating).</li>
                            <li>Team Member (Jairo Reyes) reviews the BBB webpage every day to follow up on existing and/or new reviews/complaints.</li>
                            <li>If a new BBB review/complaint is filed, we will respond through the platform, acknowledging the inconvenience this may have caused and assuring them we are committed to helping resolve the situation.</li>
                            <li>We will research everything related to the transaction/experience the patient is escalating.</li>
                            <li>After collecting all information, we will create a BBB ticket so that the store can be in the loop and provide an answer within 48 hours. We always give a sooner due date than the actual one so that stores can have a greater sense of urgency.</li>
                            <li>Every time we receive an update from stores, we will post it on the BBB webpage and wait to see if the patient accepts the resolution or not.</li>
                            <li>When patients don't accept the resolution, we must ensure the resolution provided was indeed the best we could do. If so, we can partner with BBB directly to let them know we did everything in our power.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Reviews do not affect the rating itself but reflect on the company BBB profile.</li>
                            <li>We are committed to responding to all incoming reviews and researching the patient in the system.</li>
                            <li>We will create a BBB ticket to notify the store and ensure we can help drive resolution for the patient.</li>
                            <li>Reviews only need to be responded to once. We only need to ensure that patients are taken care of by following up with the store.</li>
